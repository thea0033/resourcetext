TODO: Visibility and control - Players should have visibility of only certain systems and objects, and control over only certain systems and objects. 
      Multiplayer support should be easy. 
TODO: Conditional components - components that only function under certain conditions - or have different functionality based on certain conditions. 
      For example: A planet only generates biomass capacity and living space when it's within a certain distance of a sun.

      1. Energy absorption (hardcoded resource, also based on mass) exists. 
      2. If an object has more energy than its capacity, it will absorb it with energy absorption. 
      3. If we go beyond the energy absorption stat, the object will explode, and cease to exist. 
      4. Any leftover energy will be transferred to other objects, based on this: 
            1. The energy will be split evenly between any objects within 0.01 (the fudge factor) units of the object. 
            2. If no such objects exist, this calculation will be used: 
                  1. Take 1/d^2 for each object, where d is the distance between the object in question and the destroyed object. 
                  2. This will be the portion that each object receives. It will be adjusted to add up to 1, so that no energy is lost (or gained).
      5. Laser energy relays - can be used to transmit energy, or transmit TOO MUCH energy (to make objects blow up) if you choose
